	Abstract = {Efforts to increase the practice of evidence-based psychotherapy in the United States have led to the formation of task forces to define, identify, and disseminate information about empirically supported psychological interventions.  The work of several such task forces and other groups reviewing empirically supported treatments ({ESTs}) in the United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere is summarized here, along with the lists of treatments that have been identified  as {ESTs}. Also reviewed is the controversy surrounding {EST} identification and dissemination, including concerns abou research methodology, external validity, and utility of {EST} research, as well as the reliability and transparency of the {EST} review process.},

	Abstract = { Die vorliegende Studie {\"u}berpr{\"u}ft die Wirksamkeit des multimodalen kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutisch orientierten „Trainings mit sozial unsicheren Kindern`` (Petermann \& Petermann, 2006) mit einem Pr{\"a}-Post-Kontrollgruppendesign. 19 sozial {\"a}ngstliche Kinder (10 M{\"a}dchen, 9 Jungen) im Alter von sieben bis zw{\"o}lf Jahren wurden einer Interventionsgruppe (n = 10) und einer Wartekontrollgruppe (n = 9) zugeordnet. F{\"u}r die {\"U}berpr{\"u}fung der Wirksamkeit des Trainings wurden neben Angaben der Eltern (Fremdeinsch{\"a}tzung) auch Ausk{\"u}nfte der Kinder (Selbsteinsch{\"a}tzung) herangezogen. Die Datenerhebungen erfolgten unmittelbar vor und nach dem Training. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass sich durch das Training die Angstsymptomatik in der Interventionsgruppe im Vergleich zur Wartekontrollgruppe deutlich verringerte. },

Measures of internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed through a composite of peer- , parent- , and self-reports. As expected, sociometric rejection was associated with more internalizing and externalizing problems. More importantly, both types of rejection sensitivity were associated with internalizing and externalizing problems after controlling for the effect of peer rejection. High levels of GRS were associated with more internalizing problems for both boys and girls. In addition, rejection sensitivity emerged as a significant moderator of the relation between rejection and externalizing problems. The nature of the moderating effect varied as function of type of rejection sensitivity and gender. Rejected girls with low GRS and rejected boys with high ORS displayed the highest levels of externalizing behavior problems.},

@article{Yeates:1989,
	Abstract = {The promotion of social problem-solving skills in school-age children has been only partially successful in improving their social adjustment. The design and evaluation of training programs has been hindered by the inadequacies of most current models of social competence and its relation to social cognition. In this paper, we delineate the necessary components of a coherent model and review the shortcomings of previous approaches. We then describe a model of the development of a specific form of social competence---namely, interpersonal negotiation strategies (INS)---and its social-cognitive underpinnings. The INS model embodies several conceptual advances compared to previous models linking social cognition to social behavior: It integrates functional (information-processing) and structural (cognitive-developmental) approaches, specifies a linkage between social cognition and action within a particular domain of social interaction, and provides for developmental, individual, and contextual variations in the expression of behavior in that domain. The implications of the INS model for social problem-solving training in the schools are reviewed, together with an example of the implementation of the model in a specific educational context. The INS model may help provide a more coherent basis for the school-based delivery of developmentally appropriate interventions designed to foster children's social skills.},

Comparisons between the two countries on the total behaviour problem scores, the total number of positive codings, the externalizing and internalizing scales and the social competence scales revealed a number of cultural differences. Greek children displayed consistently higher problem scores and lower scores on social and activities competence scores than the German children with the one exception of school competence. These results are discussed in relation to different intercultural attitudes, meanings and expectations of parents on their children.},

@article{Newcomb:1993,
	Abstract = {Two-dimensional sociometric models have had a critical role in the investigation of children's peer relations in the past decade. In a meta-analysis, fitting categorical models (L. V. Hedges, 1982), sociometric group differences on behavioral and information source typologies were assessed. The broadband behavioral analysis showed that popular children's array of competencies makes them likely recipients of positive peer nominations, whereas high levels of aggression and withdrawal and low levels of sociability and cognitive abilities are associated with rejected peer status. A consistent profile marked by less sociability and aggression emerged for neglected status. Controversial children had higher aggressive behavior than rejected children but compensated for it with significantly better cognitive and social abilities. The moderator effects of narrow-band behavioral categories and information source were also examined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Each dimension was associated with a distinct profile of peer-nominated social behavior and, in multiple regression analyses, accounted for unique variance in peer-nominated behaviors. Number of friendships was uniquely associated with prosocial skills; network centrality was uniquely associated with both prosocial and antisocial behavioral styles; and being disliked was uniquely associated with the full range of social behaviors. Results provide empirical validation for the conceptual distinctions among number of reciprocated friendships, social network centrality and being liked or disliked.},

The results were stable effects about over two years (measured by behavior assessment and reports of the parents), furthermore there was an improvement in other behavior disorders or in coping with these difficulties.
