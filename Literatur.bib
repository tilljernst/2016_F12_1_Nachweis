abstract = {The article reports about social incompetent children in the age from seven to fourteen years. Social incompetence is assumed to be the leading symptom of such children which is linked to problems in school, concentration disorders, physical restlessness and inferiority feelings. There are no explicit theories about the connections or the reciprocity of occasions between the symptoms which were demonstrated in a comparison between 16 for a therapy announced children. The ``Training mit sozial unsicheren Kindern'' by Ulrike and Franz Petermann (1989) was practised and effects were tested in a group of three children over a short and over a long period. The results were stable effects about over two years (measured by behavior assessment and reports of the parents), furthermore there was an improvement in other behavior disorders or in coping with these difficulties. The ``Training mit sozial unsicheren Kindern'' changes effectively behavior disorders of children with multiple symptoms over a long period of time.},
